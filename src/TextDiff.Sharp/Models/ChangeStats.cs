/// ChangeStats tracks three types of line modifications:
/// - Changed lines: Existing lines that were modified (combination of removal + addition)
/// - Added lines: New lines inserted into the document
/// - Deleted lines: Lines removed from the original document
///
/// This information is useful for:
/// - Generating change summaries and reports
/// - Calculating diff complexity metrics
/// - Determining processing performance characteristics
/// - Providing user feedback about modification scope
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// var stats = new ChangeStats
/// {
///     ChangedLines = 5,
///     AddedLines = 12,
///     DeletedLines = 3
/// };
///
/// Console.WriteLine($"Total modifications: {stats.ChangedLines + stats.AddedLines + stats.DeletedLines} lines");
/// Console.WriteLine($"Net line change: {stats.AddedLines - stats.DeletedLines}");
